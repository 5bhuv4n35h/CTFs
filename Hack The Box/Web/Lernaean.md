Hint:  Your target is not very good with computers. Try and guess their password to see if they may be hiding anything!

Going off the hint, I ran Burp's intruder with rockyou.txt as the wordlist against password.

Filtering out all responses with "Invalid password" shows that leonardo was the correct password.
